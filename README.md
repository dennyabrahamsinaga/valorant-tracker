# valorant-tracker
apparently, it's a bad valorant tracker lol

it's just a simple tracking apps to track your valorant account.
you can do:
1. Print Player Information
2. Get Player ID (PUUID)
3. Get Player Current Rank
4. Get Last Match

all you need just player id (puuid), region, player name, or player tag.

for example:
- puuid: 66299705-c8f9-54c6-8958-952c750842ad
- region: ap, na, eu, br, kr, latam, ...
- player name: PRX something
- player tag: 1101

i just learned python like last weeks and this is still in development so it will probably have bugs or issues 😟
but feel free to contribute to this repo, pls let me know ❤️
